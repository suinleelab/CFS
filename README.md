# Implementation of Contrastive Feature Selection (CFS)

This repository contains a public implementation of Contrastive Feature Selection
(CFS), originally described in ["Feature Selection in the Contrastive Analysis Setting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18531)
(NeurIPS 2023). The method was originally developed using Python 3.9.13 with Pytorch 1.13.0 and Pytorch-Lightning 1.9.3.

See `Grassy_MNIST_example.ipynb` for an example of how to use CFS.
